This was just a project made out of desperate situation caused by mistakes in heating system design. So my friend needed to be able to control the pump which pushes the heat towards one f the branches, for a while and also being able to turn it on/off, get some feedback etc. So far they like it and this copy/paste coding style worked for us.

Great combination of [Electrodragon's Relay board](http://www.electrodragon.com/product/esp-relay-board-il-inductive-load/) + free [www.cloudmqtt.com](www.cloudmqtt.com) and on top of all that, free mobile app [IoT MQTT Dashboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thn.iotmqttdashboard)

& This code here (which is actually simply very quick drag and drop from other projects :D):
