I believe somebody already amde this but i couldn't find it. Can be hady if you want to make possible to change "direction" of 3 different lines.

I hope it will be obvious from the images what it does.

For example:
1. have input button which i connect to another side of a PCB (just passing a line) 
2. Redirect the input button to a MCU 
3. Use output terminal as input and redirect the signal to a MCU
