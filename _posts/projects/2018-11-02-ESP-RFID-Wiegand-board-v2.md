New board for ESP-RFID Firmware :)  

"ESP-RFID Relay Board is tiny ESP12 module (ESP8266) board, designed for popular wiegand RFID readers and with esp-rfid firmware in mind :)."

It's also opensourced so if you want to explore it and find two issues that i already know about :) feel free to check it here in esp-rfid repo.

Also nice thing, Omer Siar and I, decided to integrate esp-rfid firmware and esp-rfid hardware repos. I hope to publish dedicated web page about esp-rfid project soon.
