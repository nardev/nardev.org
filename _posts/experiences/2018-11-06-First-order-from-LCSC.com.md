For quite some time i have been looking for good parts supplier. DigiKey, Mouser, RS, Farnell, TI etc. All those companies don't optimize shipping for Bosnia so it's 120EUR per package, what ever i order.  

Above all, they are usually expensive and i wasn't able to find most of what i was looking for. Maybe because lately i picked some parts that are usually available in China and those companies don't offer them or have same parts but 3-4 times more expensive.  

Asking around, some guys suggested www.lcsc.com, www.arrow.com and www.tme.eu. Checking what they offer and shipping options for Bosnia, it looks like i have great alternative for those bit fancy popular suppliers.  

First "test" order i made was from www.lcsc.com and i'm very pleased with what i have got.  

So, here is one fast box opening clip + some pics in "READ MORE" :)
